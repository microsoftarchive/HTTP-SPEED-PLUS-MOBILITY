<!-- 
This file must be hosted with HTTP over port 80 at the root path of the host 
on which the GameService.exe is running in order to allow the Silverlight client
to connect to the service, which is considered a cross domain call. 

If you are running IIS, an easy way to expose this file at the above location is to copy 
it to C:\inetpub\wwwroot (unless you are using a non-default document root location). 

The file must be accessible at http://localhost/clientaccesspolicy.xml - please verify it
by navigating to this URL in your browser before running the GameClient.
